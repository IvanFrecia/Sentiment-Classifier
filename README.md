# Sentiment-Classifier
This program detects how positive or negative each tweet is, from a synthetic twitter data in a csv file and generates a csv file that can be used to make a graph with statistics.

Provided is some synthetic twitter data in a csv file named 'project_twitter_data.csv' which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. Also words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files 'positive_words.txt' and 'negative_words.txt'.

Once the application 'TwitterSentimentClassifier.py' is ran, will generate a new csv file named 'resulting_data' that can be used in Excel, Google Spreadsheet, etc, to graph the statistics.
Provided is an xls file with an example graph using the result generated for 'Net Score' vs 'Number of Retweets'.
